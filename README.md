# PillPal

## A small group looking to bring modern solutions to medication adherence.

PillPal is a user-oriented personal assistant, designed and customized to enable the user to interact with the app. Once logged-in, users are able to store their prescription and corresponding instructions.

-	Customized to user
-	Search capabilities to ensure the user is informed of proper dosage, and potential/possible side-effects and other details (through API integration)
-	Ability to add emergency contact details
-	Keep track of regimen/prescriptions
-	A reminder for user to take their medication, including a decremental counter and a notification should a user log more than they were prescribed to take
-	Ability to add notes on each prescription
